    <p>The Labrador Retriever, often abbreviated to Labrador, is a medium-large gun dog from the United Kingdom that was developed from imported Canadian fishing dogs.
      The Labrador is one of the most popular dog breeds in a number of countries in the world, particularly in the Western world.
      The breed is best known for their obedience, loyalty, and playful composure.
      Additionally, they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs.
      Ancestors include a breed used in Newfoundland as fishing dogs, that would help in bringing in the fishing nets and recapture escaped fish.

      <p>
         German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles and acting.
         The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom.

      <h2>American Eskimo</h2>
      <img src="images/american_eskimo.png" alt="" width="400" height="400">
      <p>American Eskimo is a gorgeous dog, with his shock of white fluffy fur, round, expressive eyes, and friendly face.
         These dogs are practically the dictionary definition of ‚Äúpeople pleasers,‚Äù with a sweet, reserved personality and a deep loyalty for their family.
          If a standard American Eskimo (at 19 inches, 25 pounds) is too big for you, they come in a miniature version as well: 15 inches, 15 pounds.</p>

      <h2>Golden Retriver</h2>
      <img src="images/Golden_retriver.png" alt="">
      <p>The Golden Retriever is popular as a disability assistance dog, such as being a guide dog for the blind and a hearing dog for the deaf. In addition, they are trained to be a hunting dog, a detection dog, and a search and rescue participant. The breed's friendly, gentle temperament means it is unsuited to being a professional guard dog, but its temperament has also made it the third-most popular family dog breed (by registration) in the United States and Canada, the fifth-most popular in Brazil and Australia, and the eighth-most popular in the United Kingdom. Golden Retrievers are rarely choosy eaters, but require ample (two or more hours a day) exercise. The breed is fond of play but also highly trainable
